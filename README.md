Automating the process of calculating the amount of money I've spent at each Boba shop for the month of Feb 2021. 

I notice my spending under the "Restarants" category on my bank statement kept showing a high percentage value even though I cook a lot at home. 
I suspected it must've been the boba trips. Out of curiousity I decided to track the amount of visits to my favorite boba shops and the costs. I figure seeing the actual numbers will stop me from killing my bank account.
